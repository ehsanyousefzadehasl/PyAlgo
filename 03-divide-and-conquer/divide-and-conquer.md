## Divide-and-Conquer Algorithms

In computer science, divide and conquer is an algorithm design paradigm. A divide-and-conquer algorithm **recursively** breaks down a problem into two or more sub-problems of the **same** or **related type**, until these become **simple enough** to be solved directly.
