## Data Structures

In computer science, a data structure is a data organization, management, and storage format that enables efficient access and modification. More precisely, a data structure is a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data [from Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure#:~:text=In%20computer%20science%2C%20a%20data,be%20applied%20to%20the%20data.). Always we face a kind of tradeoff on which data structure we choose for our application. You can visit [this repository](https://github.com/ehsanyousefzadehasl/PyDS) on which I tried to review data structures in a beginner level.
